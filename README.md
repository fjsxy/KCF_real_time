### How to use ###
There are no external dependencies other than OpenCV 4.0.0. Tested on a freshly installed Ubuntu 16.04.
		cd KCF_real_time
		mkdir build
		cd build
		cmake ..
		make
		./KCF [OPTION_1] [OPTION_2] [...]

The runtracker.cpp in src is prepared to be used with the VOT toolkit.
Options available:   

gray - Use raw gray level features as in [1].   
hog - Use HOG features as in [2].   
lab - Use Lab colorspace features. This option will also enable HOG features by default.   
singlescale - Performs single-scale detection, using a variable-size window.   
fixed_window - Keep the window size fixed when in single-scale mode (multi-scale always used a fixed window).   
show - Show the results in a window.
